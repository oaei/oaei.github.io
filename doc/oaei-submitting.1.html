<h1>Submitting a data set to OAEI</h1>

<p>
The aim of this (short) document is to explain how to propose a
dataset and evaluation modalities to OAEI.
Since 2010, these rules have been made more precise.
</p>
<p>
Hereby, <i>organiser</i> denotes a group of person willing to propose
a data set to evaluate or an experiment in a particular OAEI campain.
<i>Board</i> denote the OAEI <a href="../committee.html">steering committee</a>.
</p>

<h2>Data set submission</h2>

<p>
Potential organisers must send an email providing the folowing
information to OAEI:
<ul>
<li>
A short presentation of the dataset and evaluation in very few
lines like there are in the call for participation to campaigns;</li>
<li>Name and email of the organisers;</li>
<li>Explanation of what the evaluation is suppose to show (e.g., test a
  particular feature of matchers);</li>
<li>Description of the data sets (where do they come from, if they are
  in public access -preferred- or not, their size, languages and
  features);</li>
<li>Description of the evaluation modalities and which conclusion
  could be derived from the eventual results;</li>
<li>Potential list of participating system with indication of their
  asserted willingness to participate if they have been contacted
  (this can also be "all usual participants of OAEI").</li>
</ul>
all this information, would be preferrably put available somewhere on
the web.
</p>

<h2>Your duties as an organiser</h2>

<ul>
<li>Set up a web page/site exposing the data set and explaining the rules
  to participate. This web page should follow
  the <a href="../2009/templ.html">template provided by the organisers</a>.</li>
<li>Answer to the participants and update the web page with these answers</li>
<li>Evaluate the participants results in due time and providing them
  with feedback.</li>
<li>Providing the final results in due times as (1) a web page/site,
  (2) a section in the OAEI summary paper.</li>
<li>Both web pages/sites will be relocated within the OAEI web site
  at the end of the campaign. They should be maintained until
  then. Alternatively, it is possible to ask OAEI to maintain the data track
  web page/site but this would be at the expense of responsiveness
  and at the discretion of the web site maintainer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional rules</h2>

<ul>
<li>Any track which has less than two participants independent from the organisers will be declared fruitless.</li>
</ul>
