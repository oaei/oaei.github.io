<h1>Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative</h1>

<h2>On using Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative data</h2>

<p>In order to avoid any inadequate use of the data provided by the
  Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative, we make clear the
  following rules of use of these data.</p>

<h3>Rule applying to the non public use of the data</h3>

<p>Anyone can freely use the tests and their results for evaluating and improving their programs and methods.</p>

<h3>Rules applying to contest participants</h3>

<p>The participants to some evaluation campaign can publish the results as long as they cite the source of the tests and in which campaign it has been used.</p>

<p>The participants can compare their results with those of others published results on site as long as they also:
<ul compact="1">
<li>compare with the results of all the participants of the same test series;</li>
<li>compare with all the test set of this series.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Of course, participants can mention their participation to the campaign.</p>

<p>In case participant results have been validated, they can make
  mention of this independent validation.</p>

<h3>Rules applying to people who did not participate to an evaluation
  campaign but want to publish their results using this data</h3> 

<p>Non participants can publish their results as long as they cite the
  sources of the tests and in which campaign it has been used and they
  make clear that they did not participated to the official campaign.</p>

<p>They can compare their results with those of others published
  results on site as long as they:
<ul compact="1">
<li>cite the source of the tests and in which campaign it has been used;</li>
<li>compare with the results of all the participants of the same test series;</li>
<li>compare with all the test set of this series.</li>
</ul>

<p>They cannot pretend having run the test in the same condition as the participant nor they can pretend having their results validated.</p>

<h3>Rules applying to other cases</h3>

<p>Anyone can mention the tests and compaigns for discussing them.</p>

<p>All other use of these tests and their results are not authorized
  (you can ask for permission however to the contact point) and
  failing to comply to the requirements above is considered as unethical.</p>
